# User Registration and Management

This SwiftUI app demonstrates a simple user registration and management system, allowing users to register, view a list of registered users, and more. 

It utilizes async/await for network requests and follows modern SwiftUI patterns for state management.

## Architecture

This app uses the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern to separate the UI from the business logic, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

## API
